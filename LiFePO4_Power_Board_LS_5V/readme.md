# LiFePO4 Power Board LS 5V

Single cell LiFePO4 charger ([CN3058E](https://datasheet.lcsc.com/szlcsc/ShangHai-Consonance-Elec-CN3058E_C112011.pdf)), protector ([HY2112](https://datasheet.lcsc.com/szlcsc/1810010241_HYCON-Tech-HY2112-BB_C161942.pdf)) and 5V booster ([MT3608](https://datasheet.lcsc.com/szlcsc/XI-AN-Aerosemi-Tech-MT3608_C84817.pdf)) board with load sharing power path management.

The board was developed for 5V projects that are operated both by battery and external power. The load sharing system interrupts the connection between the battery and the load when an external power supply is connected. In this case, the project is powered by the external power supply while the battery is being charged. This protects the battery and increases its lifespan. The maximum output current is 1A.
